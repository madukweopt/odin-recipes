<p class="text">A recipe is a formula of ingredients and a list of instructions for creating prepared foods. It is used to control quality, quantity, and food costs in a foodservice operation. A recipe may be simple to complex based on the requirements of the operation and the intended user. For example, an experienced chef may need a recipe with only a few details, while a beginner cook may need more information about ingredients, preparation steps, cooking times and temperatures, visual cues, and equipment requirements. 
Recipes are formatted differently depending on its author and the intended use. Professional chefs record recipes in pocket notebooks, binders, or on digital devices, using simple to complex details, depending on the type of recipe and the experience level of the chef.  Information might include ingredients, prep steps, kitchen notes, and hand-drawn plate presentations. Recipes for the general consumer must be written with the assumption that the intended user knows very little about food preparation.</p>
